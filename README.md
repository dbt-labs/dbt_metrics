# About
This dbt package generates queries based on [metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics), introduced to dbt Core in v1.0. For more information on metrics, such as available calculation methods, properties, and other definition parameters, please reference the documentation linked above.

## Tenets
The tenets of `dbt_metrics`, which should be considered during development, issues, and contributions, are:
- A metric value should be consistent everywhere that it is referenced
- We prefer generalized metrics with many dimensions over specific metrics with few dimensions
- It should be easier to use dbtâ€™s metrics than it is to avoid them
- Organization and discoverability are as important as precision
- One-off models built to power metrics are an anti-pattern

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/metrics/latest/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `package.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/metrics
    version: [">=1.5.0", "<1.6.0"]
```

## Supported Adapters
The adapaters that are currently supported in the dbt_metrics package are:
- Snowflake
- BigQuery
- Redshift
- Postgres
- Databricks


# Macros

## Calculate
The calculate macro performs the metric aggregation and returns the dataset based on the specifications
of the metric definition and the options selected in the macro. It can be accessed [like any other macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/jinja-macros#using-a-macro-from-a-package): 

```sql
select * 
from {{ metrics.calculate(
    metric('new_customers'),
    grain='week',
    dimensions=['plan', 'country'],
    secondary_calculations=[
        metrics.period_over_period(comparison_strategy="ratio", interval=1, alias="pop_1wk"),
        metrics.period_over_period(comparison_strategy="difference", interval=1),

        metrics.period_to_date(aggregate="average", period="month", alias="this_month_average"),
        metrics.period_to_date(aggregate="sum", period="year"),

        metrics.rolling(aggregate="average", interval=4, alias="avg_past_4wks"),
        metrics.rolling(aggregate="min", interval=4)
    ],
    start_date='2022-01-01',
    end_date='2022-12-31',
    where="plan='filter_value'"
) }}
```
If no `grain` is provided to the macro in the query then the dataset returned will not be time-bound.

`start_date` and `end_date` are optional. When not provided, the spine will span all dates from oldest to newest in the metric's dataset. This default is likely to be correct in most cases, but you can use the arguments to either narrow the resulting table or expand it (e.g. if there was no new customers until 3 January but you want to include the first two days as well). Both values are inclusive.

### Supported Inputs

| Input       | Example     | Description | Required   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| metric_list | `metric('some_metric')`, [`metric('some_metric')`,`metric('some_other_metric')`] | The metric(s) to be queried by the macro. If multiple metrics required, provide in list format.  | Required |
| grain       | `day`, `week`, `month` | The time grain that the metric will be aggregated to in the returned dataset | Optional |
| dimensions  | [`plan`, `country`, `some_predefined_dimension_name`] | The dimensions you want the metric to be aggregated by in the returned dataset | Optional |
| start_date  | `2022-01-01` | Limits the date range of data used in the metric calculation by not querying data before this date | Optional |
| end_date    | `2022-12-31` | Limits the date range of data used in the metric claculation by not querying data after this date | Optional |
| where       | `plan='paying_customer'` | A sql statment, or series of sql statements, that alter the **final** CTE in the generated sql. Most often used to limit the data to specific values of dimensions provided | Optional |
| date_alias       | `'date_field'` | A string value that aliases the date field in the final dataset | Optional |

## Develop
There are times when you want to test what a metric might look like before defining it in your project. In these cases you should use the `develop` metric, which allows you to provide a single metric in a contained yml in order to simulate what the metric might loook like if defined in your project.

```sql
{% set my_metric_yml -%}
{% raw %}

metrics:
  - name: develop_metric
    model: ref('fact_orders')
    label: Total Discount ($)
    timestamp: order_date
    time_grains: [day, week, month]
    calculation_method: average
    expression: discount_total
    dimensions:
      - had_discount
      - order_country

{% endraw %}
{%- endset %}

select * 
from {{ metrics.develop(
        develop_yml=my_metric_yml,
        metric_list=['develop_metric']
        grain='month'
        )
    }}
```

### Supported Inputs
| Input       | Example     | Description | Required   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| metric_list | `('some_metric')`, [`('some_metric')`,`('some_other_metric')`] | The metric(s) to be queried by the macro. If multiple metrics required, provide in list format. Do not provide in `metric('name)` format as that triggers dbt parsing for metric that doesn't exist. Just provide the name of the metric.  | Required |
| grain       | `day`, `week`, `month` | The time grain that the metric will be aggregated to in the returned dataset | Optional |
| dimensions  | [`plan`, `country`, `some_predefined_dimension_name` | The dimensions you want the metric to be aggregated by in the returned dataset | Optional |
| start_date  | `2022-01-01` | Limits the date range of data used in the metric calculation by not querying data before this date | Optional |
| end_date    | `2022-12-31` | Limits the date range of data used in the metric claculation by not querying data after this date | Optional |
| where       | `plan='paying_customer'` | A sql statment, or series of sql statements, that alter the **final** CTE in the generated sql. Most often used to limit the data to specific values of dimensions provided | Optional |
| date_alias       | `'date_field'` | A string value that aliases the date field in the final dataset | Optional |

### Multiple Metrics Or Derived Metrics
If you have a more complicated use case that you are interested in testing, the develop macro also supports this behavior. The only caveat is that **you must include the raw tags** for any provided metric yml that contains a derived metric. Example below:

```sql
{% set my_metric_yml -%}
{% raw %}

metrics:
  - name: develop_metric
    model: ref('fact_orders')
    label: Total Discount ($)
    timestamp: order_date
    time_grains: [day, week, month]
    calculation_method: average
    expression: discount_total
    dimensions:
      - had_discount
      - order_country

  - name: derived_metric
    label: Total Discount ($)
    timestamp: order_date
    time_grains: [day, week, month]
    calculation_method: derived
    expression: "{{ metric('develop_metric') }} - 1 "
    dimensions:
      - had_discount
      - order_country

  - name: some_other_metric_not_using
    label: Total Discount ($)
    timestamp: order_date
    time_grains: [day, week, month]
    calculation_method: derived
    expression: "{{ metric('derived_metric') }} - 1 "
    dimensions:
      - had_discount
      - order_country

{% endraw %}
{%- endset %}

select * 
from {{ metrics.develop(
        develop_yml=my_metric_yml,
        metric_list=['derived_metric']
        grain='month'
        )
    }}
```

The above example will return a dataset that contains the metric provided in the metric list (`derived_metric`) and the parent metric (`develop_metric`). It will **not** contain `some_other_metric_not_using` as it is not designated in the metric list or a parent of the metrics included.

## Available calculation methods
The method of calculation (aggregation or derived) that is applied to the expression.

|  Metric Calculation Method  |  Description                                                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| count          | This metric type will apply the `count` aggregation to the specified field |
| count_distinct | This metric type will apply the `count` aggregation to the specified field, with an additional distinct statement inside the aggregation |
| sum            | This metric type will apply the `sum` aggregation to the specified field |
| average        | This metric type will apply the `average` aggregation to the specified field |
| min            | This metric type will apply the `min` aggregation to the specified field |
| max            | This metric type will apply the `max` aggregation to the specified field |
| median            | This metric type will apply the `median` aggregation to the specified field, or an alternative `percentile_cont` aggregation if `median` is not available |
|derived | This metric type is defined as any _non-aggregating_ calculation of 1 or more metrics  |

# Use cases and examples

## Jaffle Shop Metrics
For those curious about how to implement metrics in a dbt project, please reference the [`jaffle_shop_metrics`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_metrics). 

# Secondary calculations
Secondary calculations are window functions which act on the primary metric or metrics. You can use them to compare values to an earlier period and calculate year-to-date sums or rolling averages. The use of secondary calculations requires a `grain` input in the macro.

Create secondary calculations using the convenience [constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)) macros. Alternatively, you can manually create a list of dictionary entries (not recommended).

<details> <summary> Example of manual dictionary creation (not recommended) </summary>

  Creating a calculation this way has no input validation. 
  ```python
  [
      {"calculation": "period_over_period", "interval": 1, "comparison_strategy": "difference", "alias": "pop_1mth"},
      {"calculation": "rolling", "interval": 3, "aggregate": "sum"}
  ]
  ```
  
</details>

Column aliases are [automatically generated](#secondary-calculation-column-aliases), but you can override them by setting `alias`. 

## Period over Period ([source](/macros/secondary_calculations/secondary_calculation_period_over_period.sql))

The period over period secondary calculation performs a calculation against the metric(s) in question by either determining the difference or the ratio between two points of time. This other point in time is determined by the input variable which looks at the grain selected in the macro. 

Constructor: `metrics.period_over_period(comparison_strategy, interval [, alias, metric_list])`

| Input                  | Example | Description | Required |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| `comparison_strategy`      | `ratio` or `difference` | How to calculate the delta between the two periods | Yes |
| `interval`                 | 1 | Integer - the number of time grains to look back | Yes |
| `alias`                    | `week_over_week` | The column alias for the resulting calculation | No |
| `metric_list`              | `base_sum_metric` | List of metrics that the secondary calculation should be applied to. Default is all metrics selected | No |

## Period to Date ([source](/macros/secondary_calculations/secondary_calculation_period_to_date.sql))

The period to date secondary calculation performs an aggregation on a defined **period** of time that is equal to or coarser (higher, more aggregated) than the grain selected. Great example of this is when you want to display a month_to_date value alongside your weekly grained metric.

Constructor: `metrics.period_to_date(aggregate, period [, alias, metric_list])`

| Input                  | Example | Description | Required |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| `aggregate`                | `max`, `average` | The aggregation to use in the window function. Options vary based on the primary aggregation and are enforced in [validate_aggregate_coherence()](/macros/secondary_calculations/validate_aggregate_coherence.sql). | Yes |
| `period`                   | `"day"`, `"week"` | The time grain to aggregate to. One of [`"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, `"quarter"`, `"year"`]. Must be at equal or coarser (higher, more aggregated) granularity than the metric's grain (see [Time Grains](#time-grains) below). In example grain of `month`, the acceptable periods would be `month`, `quarter`, or `year`. | Yes |
| `alias`                    | `month_to_date` | The column alias for the resulting calculation | No |
| `metric_list`              | `base_sum_metric` | List of metrics that the secondary calculation should be applied to. Default is all metrics selected | No |

## Rolling ([source](/macros/secondary_calculations/secondary_calculation_rolling.sql))

The rolling secondary calculation performs an aggregation on a number of rows in metric dataset. For example, if the user selects the `week` grain and sets a rolling secondary calculation to `4` then the value returned will be a rolling 4 week calculation of whatever aggregation type was selected. If the `interval` input is not provided then the rolling caclulation will be unbounded on all preceding rows.

Constructor: `metrics.rolling(aggregate [, interval, alias, metric_list])`

| Input                      | Example | Description | Required |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| `aggregate`                | `max`, `average` | The aggregation to use in the window function. Options vary based on the primary aggregation and are enforced in [validate_aggregate_coherence()](/macros/secondary_calculations/validate_aggregate_coherence.sql). | Yes |
| `interval`                 | 1 | Integer - the number of time grains to look back | No |
| `alias`                    | `month_to_date` | The column alias for the resulting calculation | No |
| `metric_list`              | `base_sum_metric` | List of metrics that the secondary calculation should be applied to. Default is all metrics selected | No |

## Prior ([source](/macros/secondary_calculations/secondary_calculation_prior.sql))

The prior secondary calculation returns the value from a specified number of intervals prior to the row. 

Constructor: `metrics.prior(interval [, alias, metric_list])`

| Input                      | Example | Description | Required |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| `interval`                 | 1 | Integer - the number of time grains to look back | Yes |
| `alias`                    | `2_weeks_prior` | The column alias for the resulting calculation | No |
| `metric_list`              | `base_sum_metric` | List of metrics that the secondary calculation should be applied to. Default is all metrics selected | No |


# Customisation
Most behaviour in the package can be overridden or customised.

## Metric Configs

Metric nodes now accept `config` dictionaries like other dbt resources (beginning in dbt-core v1.3+). Metric configs can specified in the metric yml itself or for groups of metrics in the `dbt_project.yml` file.

```yml
# in metrics.yml
version: 2

metrics:
  - name: config_metric
    label: Example Metric with Config
    model: ref('my_model')
    calculation_method: count
    timestamp: date_field
    time_grains: [day, week, month]

    config:
      enabled: True
```

Or:

```yml
# in dbt_project.yml

metrics: 
  your_project_name: 
    +enabled: true
```

The metrics package contains validation on the configurations you're able to provide.

### Accepted Metric Configurations

Below is the list of metric configs currently accepted by this package.

| Config | Type | Accepted Values | Default Value | Description |
|--------|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | True/False | True | Enables or disables a metric node. When disabled, dbt will not consider it as part of your project. |
| `treat_null_values_as_zero` | boolean | True/False | True | Controls the `coalesce` behavior for metrics. By default, when there are no observations for a metric, the output of the metric as well as period Over period secondary calculations will include a `coalesce({{ field }}, 0)` to return 0's rather than nulls. Setting this config to False instead returns `NULL` values. |
| `restrict_no_time_grain_false` | boolean | True/False | False | Controls whether this metric can be queried without a provided time grain. By default, all metrics will be able to be queried without a `grain` and aggregated in a non time-bound way. This config will restrict that behavior and require a `grain` input in order to query the metric. |

## Window Periods 
Version `0.4.0` of this package, and beyond, offers support for the `window` attribute of the metric definition. This alters the underlying query to allow the metric definition to contain a window of time, such as the past 14 days or the past 3 months. Utilizing the window functionality requires a `grain` be provided in the query.

More information can be found in the [`metrics` page of dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics)/.

## Derived Metrics 
__Note: In version `0.4.0`, `expression` metrics were renamed to `derived`__
Version `0.3.0` of this package, and beyond, offer support for `derived` metrics! More information around this calculation_method can be found in the[`metrics` page of dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics)/.


## Multiple Metrics
There may be instances where you want to return multiple metrics within a single macro. This is possible by providing a list of metrics instead of a single metric. See example below:

```sql
  select *
  from 
  {{ metrics.calculate(
      [metric('base_sum_metric'), metric('base_average_metric')], 
      grain='day', 
      dimensions=['had_discount']
      )
  }}
```

**Note**: The metrics must share the `time_grain` selected in the macro AND the `dimensions` selected in the macro. If these are not shared between the 2+ metrics, this behaviour will fail. Additionally, secondary calculations can be used for multiple metrics but each secondary calculation will be applied against each metric and returned in a field that matches the following pattern: `metric_name_secondary_calculation_alias`.


## Where Clauses
Sometimes you'll want to see the metric in the context of a particular filter but this filter isn't neccesarily part of the metric definition. In this case, you can use the `where` input for the metrics package. It takes a list of `sql` statements and adds them in as filters to the final CTE in the produced SQL. 

Additionally, this input can be used by BI Tools to as a way for filters in their UI to be passed through into the metric logic.

## Calendar 
The package comes with a [basic calendar table](/models/dbt_metrics_default_calendar.sql), running between 2010-01-01 and 2029-12-31 inclusive. You can replace it with any custom calendar table which meets the following requirements:
- Contains a `date_day` column. 
- Contains the following columns: `date_week`, `date_month`, `date_quarter`, `date_year`, or equivalents. 
- Additional date columns need to be prefixed with `date_`, e.g. `date_4_5_4_month` for a 4-5-4 retail calendar date set. Dimensions can have any name (see [dimensions on calendar tables](#dimensions-on-calendar-tables)).

To do this, set the value of the `dbt_metrics_calendar_model` variable in your `dbt_project.yml` file: 
```yaml
#dbt_project.yml
config-version: 2
[...]
vars:
    dbt_metrics_calendar_model: my_custom_calendar
```

### Dimensions from calendar tables
You may want to aggregate metrics by a dimension in your custom calendar table, for example `is_weekend`. You can include this within the list of `dimensions` in the macro call **without** it needing to be defined in the metric definition. 

To do so, set a list variable at the project level called `custom_calendar_dimension_list`, as shown in the example below.

```yml
vars:
  custom_calendar_dimension_list: ["is_weekend"]
```

The `is_weekend` field can now be used by your metrics. 

## Time Grains 
The package protects against nonsensical secondary calculations, such as a month-to-date aggregate of data which has been rolled up to the quarter. If you customise your calendar (for example by adding a [4-5-4 retail calendar](https://calogica.com/sql/dbt/2018/11/15/retail-calendar-in-sql.html) month), you will need to override the [`get_grain_order()`](/macros/secondary_calculations/validate_grain_order.sql) macro. In that case, you might remove `month` and replace it with `month_4_5_4`. All date columns must be prefixed with `date_` in the table. Do not include the prefix when defining your metric, it will be added automatically.

## Custom aggregations 
To create a custom primary aggregation (as exposed through the `calculation_method` config of a metric), create a macro of the form `metric_my_aggregate(expression)`, then override the [`gen_primary_metric_aggregate()`](/macros/sql_gen/gen_primary_metric_aggregate.sql) macro to add it to the dispatch list. The package also protects against nonsensical secondary calculations such as an average of an average; you will need to override the [`get_metric_allowlist()`](/macros/secondary_calculations/validate_aggregate_coherence.sql)  macro to both add your new aggregate to to the existing aggregations' allowlists, and to make an allowlist for your new aggregation:
```
    {% do return ({
        "average": ['max', 'min'],
        "count": ['max', 'min', 'average', 'my_new_aggregate'],
        [...]
        "my_new_aggregate": ['max', 'min', 'sum', 'average', 'my_new_aggregate']
    }) %}
```

To create a custom secondary aggregation (as exposed through the `secondary_calculations` input in the `metric` macro), create a macro of the form `secondary_calculation_my_calculation(metric_name, dimensions, calc_config)`, then override the [`perform_secondary_calculations()`](/macros/secondary_calculations/perform_secondary_calculation.sql) macro. 

## Secondary calculation column aliases
Aliases can be set for a secondary calculation. If no alias is provided, one will be automatically generated. To modify the existing alias logic, or add support for a custom secondary calculation, override [`generate_secondary_calculation_alias()`](/macros/secondary_calculations/generate_secondary_calculation_alias.sql).
